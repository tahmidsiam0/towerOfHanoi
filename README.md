This is a practice project I have completed after learning basic JavaScript.
It is totally focused on functionality, game logic, and behavior; didn't really focused on front end/styling part. 
Please accept my apology for a very bad front end!
It would be a wise decision not to judge my front end/designing skill upon this.
